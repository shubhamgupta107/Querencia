# Secure-Local-Interactive-Platform-in-DrRacket

This is a multipurpose software designed in Drracket which has enjoyable
and intellectual games and which enables a user to connect to a LAN/WiFi based network and
play a game with another user (who is online) as well as engage in real time interaction (like
chatting or sharing data) with the user. This is possible only if the host is online, otherwise the
user can play any of the two games on the software with the machine. This software aims at
extending the limits of Racket as a language and has done so to some extent.

We have given the software a very user friendly GUI and which gives the user two options on running the software
 - Stay offline and play WORD-SEARCH or [MANCALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) with the machine.
 - Go online after logging-in with a username and password if the user is already registered in the host server, or register to the host servers.

 ## How to run the Program
 ```
 install drRacket on your computer
 open main.rkt and run the program
 ```
 ### Connecting Online
 Make sure that you and your partner are on same WiFi or LAN and you know the IP address of the other person. One person will be host and other can send a request to other to connect. After connecting online either you can play games or chat with each other. Make sure that host stays online to run the connection smoothly.
